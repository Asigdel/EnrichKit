# EnrichKit

The goal of EnrichKit is to **perform over-representation** test of biological pathways within a given gene set pair (*SignificantGenes* and *TotolGenes*) based on hypergeometric distribution (**Fisher's exact test**). Gene sets could possily be non-preserved co-expression modules, differentially expressed gene (DEG), genes flagged by significant SNPs and etc..

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" ", out.width = '400%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-Enrich_Illustration.png")
```

Currently, **six pathway/annotation databases** are integrated:

- [Gene Ontology](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/biomart)
- [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
- [Interpro](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/biomart)
- [MeSH](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=The+MeSH+translation+maintenance+system%3A+structure%2C+interface+design%2C+and+implementation.&btnG=)
- [Reactome](https://reactome.org/download-data)
- [Molecular Signatures](https://data.broadinstitute.org/gsea-msigdb/msigdb/release/)

Also, gene identifiers could be *Ensembl Gene ID*, *EntrezID* or *HGNC Gene Symbol*.  

Note current release can only support **Bos Taurus**, other organism might be included in future release.  

Latest update 06-08-2020.  

## Installation

Currently not published on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

Users are welcome to use the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r ID installation, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liulihe954/EnrichKit")

```

## Example

Soppose we have identified 2 out 5 DEG in each of the two lactations. 

```{r ID convert example}
library(EnrichKit)
# input format
Sig_lac1 =   c("ENSBTAG00000012594","ENSBTAG00000004139")
Sig_lac2 =   c("ENSBTAG00000009188","ENSBTAG00000001258")
Tot_lac1 = c("ENSBTAG00000012594","ENSBTAG00000004139","ENSBTAG00000018278","ENSBTAG00000021997","ENSBTAG00000008482")
Tot_lac2 = c("ENSBTAG00000009188","ENSBTAG00000001258","ENSBTAG00000021819","ENSBTAG00000019404","ENSBTAG00000015212")

# convert and orgnize
GeneInfo = convertNformatID(GeneSetNames=c("lactation1","lactation2"),
                            SigGene_list = list(Sig_lac1,Sig_lac2),
                            TotalGene_list = list(Tot_lac1,Tot_lac2),
                            IDtype = "ens")
GeneInfo
```

With simply providing **significant/total gene sets** as **list objects**, *convertNformatID()* automatically match and organize gene identifiers across different identifiers, namely, coordinating **Ensembl Gene ID**, **EntrezID**, **Gene Symbol** and **HGNC suggested symbol** if discrepancy was found. Also, an additional column indicating significance status will be added (1 stands for significant and 0 for insignificant).

Objects resulted from last step (**GeneInfo**) could be fed into the subsequent loop processes with great cohesion.   

Here, six databases were build-in beforehand, users can simply indicate which database to use by providing parameter **Database = "xxx"** in the function body. 

```{r enrich example, eval=F}
HyperGEnrich(GeneSet = GeneInfo,
             Database = 'kegg', #'go','kegg,'interpro','mesh','msig','reactome'
             minOverlap = 4, # minimum overlap of pathway genes and total genes
             pvalue_thres = 0.05, # pvalue of fisher's exact test
             adj_pvalue_thres = 1, # adjusted pvalues based on multiple testing correction
             padj_method = "BH",
             NewDB = F)
```

The function does not return anything, however, all the results would be packed into *.RData* file and saved into current working directory. There are two elements in the resulting *.RData* object:

- **results_raw** records every single term/pathway tested  
- **results** contains significant results based on the prometers provided.

## About Databases

Although databases will be updated on regular bases (tentatively half-yearly), users are free to request an update or update/download databases by themselves using the built-in database updating functions. 

There are totally six dataset being subject to update.

```{r database update, eval=F}
# Note that these functions are potentially time-comsuming.
# New databases (in .RData format) will be stored in current working directory
GO_DB_Update()
KEGG_DB_Update()
Interpro_DB_Update()
MeSH_DB_Update()
Msig_DB_Update()
Reactome_DB_Update()
```

Please note, when you use new databases, please make sure:  

- Put the newly gathered database in your current working directory, they could not be linked otherwise.  
- Make sure to set NewDB parameter to **T**.  

```{r enrich example with new DB,eval=F}
HyperGEnrich(GeneSet = GeneInfo,
             Database = 'kegg', #'go','kegg,'interpro','mesh','msig','reactome'
             minOverlap = 4,
             pvalue_thres = 0.05, # pvalue of fisher's exact test
             adj_pvalue_thres = 1, # adjusted pvalues based on multiple testing correction
             padj_method = "BH",
             NewDB = T) ###
```
